Welcome to the journey of Reichan! You might be wondering, "What exactly is Reichan?" Well, it's a completely (not at all) chan, and we’re diving deep into building a custom API with TypeScript.
## Building Reichan: From Concept to Code

Our project is focused on developing an API that serves as the backbone of the Reichan platform. By leveraging TypeScript, we aim to create a scalable, easy-to-maintain system that can grow alongside our needs. The process has been both challenging and exciting, but we’re learning more every day.

## What's Next? A Simple Web Interface

While the core of Reichan is all about the API, we’re not stopping there. The next phase of the project will involve creating a clean, simple interface using just HTML and CSS. This will allow users to interact with Reichan’s functionalities in an intuitive way.

Stay tuned as we continue to build and expand Reichan! If you're a developer, or just someone interested in how APIs come to life, we’ll be sharing updates and insights throughout the journey.
