![Rei shots the big boss of script languages](https://github.com/Alekssandher/reichan-site/blob/main/static/images/posts/api-changes/rei-kills-typescript.png?raw=true "Rei shoting TypeScript with a sniper rifle") 

## What happened?
Last weeks, I started studying the development of APIs with C#, and I have to admit that I quickly fell in love with it. It’s safe to say that I’ve now moved on from TypeScript, and I’m diving headfirst into the world of API development using C#.

I was flerting with that for a long time, I dislike script languages and think that they shouldn't be used in back-end. I'm not saying that TypeScript/JavaScript is a bad language, but i preffer a hard typed language and think that  they should be used for what they were designed for. TypeScript has a lot of improviment when compared to JavaScript, like the POO and other cool stuff like interfaces and typing, but in the end It's still JavaScript. C# has a more mature ambient for back-end development, the performance is better and also it has better memory controll.
