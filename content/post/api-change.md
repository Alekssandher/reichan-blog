## Why We Switched to C#

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been exploring API development with C#, and I have to say—it’s been a game-changer. This shift marks the end of my journey with TypeScript for back-end development. While TypeScript has served us well, I’ve decided it’s time to embrace a more robust and performance-oriented solution.

### A New Direction: Why C#?

For a long time, I’ve been contemplating a move away from scripting languages for back-end development. While TypeScript brought significant improvements over JavaScript—like object-oriented programming (OOP), interfaces, and typing—it still carries some of JavaScript’s inherent limitations. 

C#, on the other hand, offers:

- **Performance:** With its compiled nature, C# delivers faster execution and better resource management compared to interpreted scripting languages.
- **Strong Typing:** C# enforces a stricter type system, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Mature Ecosystem:** The .NET framework provides a well-established environment with tools and libraries tailored for enterprise-grade applications.
- **Memory Management:** C# offers better control over memory usage, which is crucial for scaling applications effectively.

### TypeScript Isn’t Bad—It’s Just Not for Me

I want to make it clear: TypeScript is an excellent language with its place in modern development. Its introduction of OOP features, static typing, and other enhancements has elevated JavaScript programming significantly. However, I believe scripting languages like TypeScript and JavaScript are best suited for front-end development or small-scale projects, not back-end systems.

C#, in contrast, feels like a natural fit for building APIs. It combines high performance with a developer-friendly syntax, making the development process smoother and more enjoyable.

### Moving Forward

This transition to C# is an exciting chapter for our project. The decision wasn’t made lightly, but I’m confident it’s the right one for the future of our API.
